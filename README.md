# CS-546 Final Project
### Team: RAP: Ruthy Levi, Aditya Munot, Parth Purohit

Hi everyone! This is our final project for the Web Programming course at Stevens. In this project, called "Organizer", we have created a web app which is your daily schedule and finance assistant.

Features:
- Schedule: layout your daily thoughts, comments, notes, and events. The timed trigger event will always send you an email.
- Finance Organiser: Organiser your finance Like spending, saving and recurring bills. 
- A pie-based chart to show spending, saving in the category. 

## How To Run:
Head to your terminal, `git clone` this repository, and then `cd` into the project directory. Then, write `npm i` to get the dependencies installed.  After that, you may want to run an `npm test` just to make sure your system is working correctly.

Now, start up the server with an `node app.js` and head on over to `localhost:3000/home`. Once there, click around and explore! Feel free to make tasks, as well as an account!
